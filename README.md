# Neuroidal Network Application

A Neuroid is a neuron-model based on comparision,frequency modulation and demodulation.
The purpose of this application eventually is to be able to detect Tachycardia (A fast heart rhythm with a rate of more than 100 beats per minute).
This is being developed based on an IEEE paper 'The Neuroid: A Novel and Simplified Neuron-Model'
